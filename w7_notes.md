## Reading

In addition to styling elements, CSS is used for creating page layouts. 
There are several techniques to chose from when creating page layouts, such as floating elements, flexbox or grid layouts.
In addition, HTLM 5 provides elements that are used specifically for creating page layouts, such as header, footer, nav, aside, section and article.
These elements provide clearer code compared with multiple <div> elements used as containers.
