## Email
Students can use email to communicate with me regarding private matters such as grades. However, questions that are content-related can benefit all students; therefore, please ask those either in the face-to-face environment or in our virtual course discussion forums. I will be checking forums daily and receive email notifications when students post. This helps speed up the response process along with the fact that your peers can also help answer your questions.

## Q&A Forum on Canvas
I have created a Q&A Forum in the Discussions section. 
If you have a question about the course or the content, please post it in this forum. If you see a question from a peer that you know the answer to, please feel free to answer it. This reduces the lag time between asking a question and getting an answer. Course questions should be posted here rather than being sent to my email so that all students benefit from the answer. Questions of a personal nature, such as feedback on an assignment, should be sent via the Inbox to protect your privacy.


## Academic Honesty
You will receive no credit and may be subject to disciplinary action if your graded work is determined not to be your own.  For more information, refer to your Academic Dishonesty Policy in the college catalog or student handbook.
