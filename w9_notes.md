**Animations, Transitions and Transformations**

CSS animations allow for gradually changing the style of an element without the use of JavaScript or jQuery. 
The animation needs to be bound to the element which will be animated. 

The main properties used in animations include:

```@keyframes

animation-name

animation-duration

animation-delay

animation-iteration-count

animation-direction

animation-timing-function

animation-fill-mode

animation
```

**CSS Transitions**

CSS transitions change the value of a property over a time duration.
A transition effect needs to know the property and the duration of the effect.

The main properties used in transitions include:

```transition
transition-delay
transition-duration
transition-property
transition-timing-function
```

**CSS Transformations**

The transform property can be used to create 2D and 3D transformations such as rotating, moving or scaling an element.
There are multiple transformation property values used in the general syntax 

transform: none|transform-functions|initial|inherit;


**Form Styles**

CSS styled forms appear more interactive and can be easier to use if the controls are vertially allgined.
